# Synapse: Latency - Interface Layer

This repository serves the surface-level interaction point for Synapse: Latency.  
It is operational. It is monitored. It is not particularly interactive.

## Structure

- `index.html` — Main interaction layer.
- `/js/` — Animation routines, cursor behavior, internal signal noise.
- `/css/` — Style definitions, glitch decay, aesthetic compliance.
- `robots.txt` — Basic crawler instructions. Not legally binding.
- `core.json` — Snapshot of a previous state. No guarantees.
- `404.html` — Standard not-found return. Somewhat honest.

## Console Output

Messages may appear in the browser console.  
This is intentional.  
They are mostly noise, sometimes not.  

## License

No license has been assigned.  
Use discretion. Use nothing else.

## Closing Note

You weren’t supposed to look.  
But you did.  
Thanks.
